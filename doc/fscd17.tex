\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Syntaxes with binding are omnipresent in Programming Languages
research but also in the more practical setting of Embedded
Domain Specific Languages. The advanced features available in
some languages' type systems has made it possible to statically
enforce well-scopedness. However the user still has to write a
lot of boilerplate code to get common scope safe programs (e.g.
renaming, substitution, CPS transformation, printing with names,
etc.) and the proof that they are well-behaved.

Building on an abstract but nonetheless expressive notion of
semantics and a universe of syntaxes with binding, we demonstrate
how to implement these traversals once and for all by generic
programming, and how to derive their properties by generic proving.
All of this work has been fully formalised in Agda and is available
at \url{https://github.com/gallais/generic-syntax}.
